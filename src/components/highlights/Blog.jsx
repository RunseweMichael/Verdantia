          <li className="mb-4 text-white highlight-text" style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
            <strong className="text-success">Overwatering or Underwatering:</strong> Plants have different
            needs, and drowning them or letting them go thirsty are equally harmful.
            Learn your plantâ€™s preferred watering schedule and stick to it.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4 text-white highlight-text" style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
            <strong className="text-success">Poor Soil Preparation:</strong> Healthy soil means healthy plants.
            Before planting, enrich your soil with compost and check its drainage.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4 text-white highlight-text" style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
            <strong className="text-success">Planting in the Wrong Spot:</strong> Sun-loving crops in the
            shade or shade-loving plants in direct sun will struggle. Observe your
            gardenâ€™s light patterns before deciding where to plant.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4 text-white highlight-text" style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
            <strong className="text-success">Ignoring Pests Until Itâ€™s Too Late:</strong> Regularly inspect
            your plants for signs of pests or disease. Early action saves the harvest.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4 text-white highlight-text" style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
            <strong className="text-success">Overcrowding Plants:</strong> Giving your plants room to grow
            prevents competition for nutrients and reduces disease spread.
          </li>
        </ol>

          Gardening is a journey of learning. Avoiding these mistakes wonâ€™t just save you
